          <h2>Front End Web</h2>
          <div class="skillset-picture-circle"></div>
          <p>After teaching myself to code HTML and CSS I landed my first job as a front-end developer at Cornerstone OnDemand in 2014.  My responsibilites included slicing PSD files that I or other colleagues had created, and then turning the media into responsive HTML &amp; CSS.</p>
          <p>My work on the front end has continued throughout my career as I transitioned into javascript development.  I consider Javascript my core programming language and I obsessively continue developing my skillset in this language.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-3 news-panel-wrapper">
        <div class="news-panel">
          <h2>JavaScript</h2>
          <div  id="javascript-micro-image" class="skillset-picture-circle"></div>
          <p>Obviously javascript is part of my font-end skillset, but my diverse experience with the language deserves a bit more explanation.  I have been working with javascript since 2012 and have built a strong knowledge of its advanced concepts, including the language's unique take on object-oriented programming.</p>
          <p>In addition to my experience with libraies like jQuery &amp; Angular, I have studied the back-end capabilities of the language like NodeJS.  As my experience with javascript builds I find that list of programming tasks that cannot be solved with javascript is an ever-shrinking list.  Below is a list of some common tasks I solve with javascript on a day-to-day basis.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>making API calls with Ajax</li>
            <li>looping through API returns</li>
            <li>jQuery Animations</li>
            <li>coding business logic</li>
            <li></li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Design</h2>
          <div id="design-micro-image" class="skillset-picture-circle"></div>
          <p>The oldest of my disiplines is certainly design.  I always had a talent for 2D based design (especially drawing/painting), after completing my Art Major and becoming practiced with the Adobe suite I was able to translate my talents into web pages by mastering HTML &amp; CSS.  Part of what draws me to programming and web-based design is the maticulous level of control a developer has over their work, a control that is often desired within traditional medias like paint.</p>
          <p>My experience with traditional art has come through in my software projects.  After countless critiques of my drawings and paintings I gained an ability to step outside of my work anonymously and observe it as though it was my first time seeing it.  This gives me a unique and practical approach to page layout.</p>

          <h2>Back End &amp; DBs</h2>
          <div class="skillset-picture-circle"></div>
          <p>Node JS is my true passion when it comes to the backend.  I have used it to build APIs, connect to data bases (both SQL and Mongo), and to create simple apps that access the filesystem.  In my career I have had some experience with Java and Perl on the backend, but the dominant portion of my knowledge with back-ends comes from my personal studies with Node.</p>
          <p>I have experience working with SQL queries in a production environment, full CRUD operations.  But when it comes to databases my preference is Mongo DB.  The ability to quickly create document-based collections and shard data across servers is invaluable, not to mention the ability to view data in a JSON format as opposed to the classic SQL table structure.</p>

          <h2>A little about me:</h2>
          <p>I grew up throughout different parts of the midwest, and eventually settling in Chicago in 1999.  Growing up I studied traditional art mediums like drawing and painting, but after experimenting with programming courses back in 2012 I have found my true artistic medium and never looked back.  I am constantly programming weather its working on small passion projects, building websites, or working on whatever online course currently has my attention.</p>
          <p>Aside from coding I spend most of my free time with my lovely fiance' <span id="lovely-lady">Holly</span>, along with my friends and family.  I love being outdoors, watching hockey, or working on side projects like my 3D printer.  I can never go to long without programming though, days that don't involve coding are few and far between.</p>
          <p>I've been programming for a living since 2014.  I entered the field through a position that was focused on strong HTML/CSS skills along with design, and then quickly drifted towards javascript-heavy projects. I now spend the majority of my time at work developing javascript code for use in an enterprise application.  Currently my personal studies are focused on full-stack application development (typically MEAN stack).</p>
